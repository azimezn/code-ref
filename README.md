# Code Refactor

## Description
The given codebase had repetitive codes and I reformatted the CSS to be more DRY. The HTML was modifed to have more semantic elements; such as changing the div's to header, footer, and sections. There was an issue with the link for Search Engine Optimization and it is fixed now.
